# Linear-Regression
Linear Regression Algorithm in Python using Gradient Descent.
--------------------------------------------------------------


Input Format
-------------

Input should be provided in a txt file with csv format with target attribute at the last column.

For eg,

Independant_Attribute_1,Independant_Attribute_2,Independant_Attribute_3,Score
5,6,7,32
7,9,5,48
eof


This is obviously not a linear relationship but just an example.

Output
-------
Try it and find out.

Terms Used
----------

1)Damping Coefficient: Specify a low value if high accuracy is required which in turn will require more no. of iterations and more time.
2)Iterations: Specify a high value if low Damping coeffcient is used.
3)Damping Decay: Specify 1 or less if high accuracy is required.

REMEMBER
--------
High accuracy always requires more time.
